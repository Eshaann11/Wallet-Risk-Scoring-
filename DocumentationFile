ðŸ“˜ Documentation Summary
Data Collection: Simulated wallet-level lending activity using mock data. In production, fetch real data from Compoundâ€™s subgraph or Debank.

Feature Selection Rationale:

Behavioral: borrows, repayments, repayment ratio

Risk: liquidation events

Collateral quality: max collateral, avg ratio

Activity: time-based usage patterns

Scoring Logic:

Min-max normalized features

Weighted composite: behavior (50%), collateral (50%)

Final scaled score: bounded 0â€“1000

Outlier wallets penalized

Justification of Risk Indicators:

Wallets with missed repayments, repeated liquidations, or poor collateral management tend to pose higher lending risk

Time-variant behaviors help spot dormant or inconsistent actors

Isolation Forest used to discount outlier scoring profiles
