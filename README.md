# Compound Wallet Risk Scoring Pipeline

This repository contains a Python-based scoring pipeline designed to evaluate DeFi wallets interacting with the **Compound V2/V3 lending protocol**. The model assigns a **risk score (0â€“1000)** to each wallet based on historical lending and borrowing behavior.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Using wallet addresses as input, the pipeline:
1. Retrieves transaction activity from the Compound protocol
2. Engineers wallet-level behavioral and collateral features
3. Calculates a composite risk score using weighted metrics
4. Flags behavioral outliers using an Isolation Forest
5. Outputs final scores to a clean CSV file for downstream analysis
